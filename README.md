An example configuration of these environment variables is in the `.env.example` file.

(*): for Mongo connection string options
see [docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/v4.3/fundamentals/connection/connection-options/#connection-options)

## Run the application with `Docker`

Create your environment typing :

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then from current project directory run :

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Run the application with `springboot-plugin`

Create your environment:

```sh
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs)
```

Then from current project directory run :

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Note that with this method you would also need an active Redis instance on your local machine.
We suggest you to use the [ecommerce-local](https://github.com/pagopa/pagopa-ecommerce-local) instead.

## Code formatting

Code formatting checks are automatically performed during build phase.
If the code is not well formatted an error is raised blocking the maven build.

Helpful commands:

```sh
mvn spotless:check # --> used to perform format checks
mvn spotless:apply # --> used to format all misformatted files
```

## CI

Repo has Github workflow and actions that trigger Azure devops deploy pipeline once a PR is merged on main branch.

In order to properly set version bump parameters for call Azure devops deploy pipelines will be check for the following
tags presence during PR analysis:

| Tag                | Semantic versioning scope | Meaning                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| patch              | Application version       | Patch-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| minor              | Application version       | Minor-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| major              | Application version       | Major-bump application version into pom.xml and Chart app version |
| ignore-for-release | Application version       | Ignore application version bump                                   |
| chart-patch        | Chart version             | Patch-bump Chart version                                          |
| chart-minor        | Chart version             | Minor-bump Chart version                                          |
| chart-major        | Chart version             | Major-bump Chart version                                          |
| skip-release       | Any                       | The release will be skipped altogether                            |

For the check to be successfully passed only one of the `Application version` labels and only ones of
the `Chart version` labels must be contemporary present for a given PR or the `skip-release` for skipping release step

## Dead lettering

This microservice has a built-in logic that write events to dead letter queue.
This dead letter queue is used to store all events that cannot be processed by this microservice.
There are common scenarios for which an event can be written to a dead letter queue:

1. syntactically incorrect input event
2. unhandled exception raised during event processing
3. retry attempt exhaustion for a refund retry event or refund process interruption (because of blocking error codes as
HTTP 400 for which a retry has no meaning)
4. retry attempt exhaustion for sending user notification (mail)

### Monitoring

Since an event can be written to dead letter queue for multiple reasons (see above) there is a mechanism that,
contextually to dead letter event writing to dead letter queue,
creates an OpenTelemetry span that is used to display an overall dead letter queue event dashboard.
This span has the following fields:

| deadLetterEvent.category             | Enumeration of all possible errors that can make an event to be written to dead letter (see [Error category section](#Error-category)) | ✅         |

### Event receiver controller

This module is essentially an asynchronous event processor.

Many processed events have a visibility timeout set to make transactions event to be process after a certain delay (such
as retry event, transaction expiration event and so on).

This makes difficult to predict when an event will be visible on the queue to be processed.

One other important aspect to take into account is the fact that module undeploy will not consider in-flight event:

module shutdown can happen when the module is in the middle of an event processing, with the possible consequence of a
broken transaction history (transaction locked in a middle event)

In order to avoid such situations an event receiver locker mechanism has been implemented using Redis Stream as fun-out
mechanism:
a group of api are directly exposed by this module and, based on request input, can initiate an event receiver orderly
shutdown.

All event receivers will then complete their processing but no new event will be taken from the queues.

After all pending event processing have been completed, the deployment can be executed with the assurance that no event
processing will be stopped in the middle of its execution.

After new version have been deployed successfully, event receiver can be start again with the same api used to stop
them.

WATCH OUT!!!! Event receivers will not be restarted automatically once module have been deployed but has to be restarted
manually.

This has been done on purpose to handle deployment rollout and avoid restarting event consumers for an old POD for which
rollout phase has not been taken into account yet.

There is a postman with api request pre-configured to start/stop consumers and to query their statuses (UP, DOWN,
UNKNOWN)

The collection is stored into this repo at -> command-postman-collection/commands.postman_collection.json
